# Fabric notebook: nb_vocab
# Vocabulary extraction for the prose-fingerprint Jaccard overlap (metric 15).
# Emits a per-work vocabulary: the distinct content-word lemmas in a work, each
# with its count. Only the Python half - the Jaccard overlap itself is computed
# dbt-side. Each term lands as one raw_vocab row.
# Definitions only - nb_measure %runs this notebook, which executes every cell.
