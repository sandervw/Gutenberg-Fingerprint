-- int_measurements_normalized
-- Adds a per-metric z-score to every measurement so metrics on different scales
-- become comparable (the standardized "fingerprint" form).
-- Grain: one row per work x measured series (135 works x 63 = 8,505).
-- The z-score window partitions by the CHILD metric_name, so each series gets its
-- own mean/spread.
