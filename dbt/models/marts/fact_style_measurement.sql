-- fact_style_measurement
-- The central fact: one measured number per work per metric series, carrying the
-- raw value and its per-series z-score. Swaps work_id for the conformed work_key and
-- carries author_key direct off dim_work, so the fact attaches straight to dim_work,
-- dim_author, and dim_metric (a star) and slices by author without hopping dim_work.
-- Grain: one row per work x measured series (8,505 = 135 x 63), keyed (work_id,
-- metric_name) since multivalue concepts share one metric_key across many series.
